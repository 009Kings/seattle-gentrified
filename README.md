# Seattle Gentrified

This is a Hackathon project done with students from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, User Experience Design Immersive, and Data Science Immersive Courses.

**Overview:**

The city of Seattle has been growing exponentially for past years. As the city expands, more issues started arouse such as increase in traffic, cost of living, and pressure on low-income families.  All these issues are rooted to “Gentrification”. 

People heard of word Gentrification, but most them are not informed what Gentrification is and how fast it is happening.
By providing them an interactive website that will visualize Gentrification, we are hoping to help people to better examine and understand the issue of gentrification.
